#  READ BEFORE INT!!!
(Basically what to expect)

- Socially awkward af. Means that I am not ignoring you randomly, I'm just not sure how to continue the conversation. I only really get chatty with people I know, but if a person needs help with something I will still try my best to help.

- I have... **a lot** of ocs, mainly for selfship reasons. If you don't like that, it's honestly better for you to hide me.

- Please, if you see I am talking with someone and it's chaotic, otherwise occupied or even see in my name that I am AFK - whisper to me instead. Some people don't get it and then get mad for no reason.

- If we don't know eachother too good use tone tags/indicators with me! It helps me sm more to understand the meaning behind your words. Especially since if I somehow without the tone tags perceive your tone as passive aggressive, it will cause me to start ignoring you, avoiding you or talking less, if not bite back at what I think is an attempt at a personal attack on me. Tone indicators are such a small thing yet help IMMENSELY. People on this game can be seriously mean and insensitive sometimes, to the point it's impossible be sure whether someone is joking or actually serious.

- Despite being aroace I might make sexual jokes or even flirt. This is **purely** platonic on my part. The flirting doesn't mean anything. Sorry not sorry. I also don't take serious flirting towards my person, it makes me uncomfy. Jokingly flirting is okay if we're friends or close. 

- I say a lot of out of pocket stuff sometimes when I get comfy, sometimes they're even horrendous, but I swear it's all in good fun and I'm not actually serious.

- If I have somehow offended you, said something mean despite us getting along prior - explain this fact to me. Don't immidiately jump into insults or see it as a personal attack when it's likely either me being joking or a misunderstanding. Something I can easily correct/clarify or apologize for.

- Similarly so if I accidentally crossed a boundary of yours, tell me. I will apologize and note not to do it again.

- I don't like people dragging me into their drama for no reason or when I got nothing to do with it (mainly applied to strangers).

- I don't like being dragged into roleplays, especially romantic canon x OC ones. No, I won't sit as your fav character you ship your OC with and act lovey dovey with you. Find someone else to do that. I only let it slide with my close friends.
